# Stage, Commit, Push, Pull

Now that you've pushed your code, you have the elements of what you need to work collaboratively using `git`.  Ultimately, you'll be in a cycle that looks like this:

* Work on your code
* Stage & Commit your changes: `git add <files> && git commit -m <your message>`
* Push your changes: `git push origin master`
* If others are working on the same project, you will want to pull changes from the server.
* Pulling looks like `git pull origin master`

You may be wondering about `origin master`.  If you recall from the previous step, we created the remote with:

`git remote add origin git@github.com:<your_username>/<your_repo>.git`

You can see `origin` is just an alias for the remote server.

As for `master`, that is the name of the branch into which you are pushing.
