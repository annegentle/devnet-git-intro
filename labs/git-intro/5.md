# Ooops!  I made a mistake!

If you made a simple mistake in your file, the best option is to fix it and create a new commit.

You may have noticed that `Emerson` was misspelled in our previous commit.  Fix that by making your change in your file, and performing:

```
git add first.txt
git commit -m "Fix typo"
```

# Viewing the differences between two commits

Now that you have a few checkins, you can review changes among commits.  You can do that with the command `git diff <commit> <commit>`.

```
> git diff 7be53cc d553bb
```

```diff
diff --git a/first.txt b/first.txt
index d5ff131..86a582c 100644
