# Objective

This lab will provide you with the fundamentals of the distributed version control system `git`.

Completion time: 30 minutes

# Prerequisites

You will need a git client on your workstation.  If you are a DevNet event, such as at CiscoLive! the workstations are pre-installed with `git`.

# What is version control vs. distributed version control?

Unlike version control systems like `subversion`, `git` is a **distributed** version control system.  What this means is that `git` is really great for sharing code across many individuals, but still being able to keep your changes in-sync and of course properly versioned.  GitHub is not the same as `git`.  **Note:** GitHub is a company and a service that has popularized the `git` protocol, and provides a centralized community for discovering code.  As a small bit of trivia, `git` was largely created by Linus Torvalds -- the founder of the Linux kernel.
